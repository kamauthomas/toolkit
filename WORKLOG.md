## 2026-08-20 — Contain confirmed WordPress compromise exposure
**Area:** security operations
**Environments:** production ✅
**Commit(s):** this commit

Reviewed the 14 August Element Pack supply-chain incident evidence and current
server state without attaching to an operator's browser. Eventer 3.9.6 and the
abandoned `Old Sites` WordPress tree remained present; the latter's
`readme.html` and 180 MB `toolkitiskills.zip` were publicly downloadable.
Added a retained, browser-free cPanel containment script, backed up the original
production root `.htaccess`, blocked both abandoned-site artifacts, and placed a
deny-all quarantine rule in Eventer's directory. This is reversible containment
only: no users or files were deleted, and credential/session rotation is still
required.

**Verified by:** remote rules fetched back byte-identical; the two abandoned
artifacts and Eventer's main PHP file return 403; production home and Apply
remain 200. Known `wp-smart-thumbnails/emer-run.php` and `/w2.js` indicators
remain 404, while the previously protected `local.tar` and `uploads/addon.zip`
remain 403.
**Follow-ups:** confirm/remove rogue administrator IDs 7–15, rotate every
legitimate administrator password and WordPress salts/sessions, remove Eventer
and the abandoned install after a retained backup, and retrieve the completed
cPGuard full-account scan result.

## 2026-08-20 — Publish the institutional programme footprint
**Area:** website content
**Environments:** demo ✅ · prod ✅
**Commit(s):** this commit

Added a theme-owned `/footprint/` page that presents 28 dated programme
milestones and their named partners from 2014 through current work extending to
2026. The route includes canonical metadata, schema and sitemap integration,
with a responsive timeline that does not depend on a database page builder. The
browser-free, drift-preserving release script and operating notes are retained
under `scripts/deployment/` for manual inspection and future reuse.

**Verified by:** full child-theme PHP lint, JavaScript syntax and whitespace
checks; demo desktop/mobile headless renders; demo then production returned 200
uncached and from LiteSpeed cache on release `2026.08.12.12`, with one H1, 13
eras, 28 milestones, canonical/robots/schema signals and sitemap inclusion.
Home, Apply, Graduation and Testimonials remained 200 on production.
**Follow-ups:** none.

## 2026-08-20 — Make a rejected Mzizi submission re-sendable
**Area:** admissions relay
**Environments:** demo ✅ · prod ✅
**Commit(s):** ae081f4

Mzizi answers `SubmitOnlineApplication` with HTTP 409 when it declines an
application. Every non-2xx result was being treated as `delivery_unconfirmed`,
and the admin hid the release form for failed records — so a 409 left the
application with no way to re-send it at all; staff could only mark it
delivered. Now a 4xx (Mzizi explicitly did not store it, so a re-send cannot
duplicate the applicant) marks the record `relay_failed` and retryable, and the
Applications screen offers "Re-send to Mzizi" with the last error shown inline.
Ambiguous outcomes (timeouts, 5xx, unreadable bodies) still become
`delivery_unconfirmed` and must be checked in Mzizi first.

**Verified by:** anchored deploy confirmed on both servers (4xx branch and
re-send control present); `toolkitafrica.ac.ke/apply/` → 200 with release
`2026.08.12.11`, form present, no PHP errors.
**Follow-ups:** open a `relay_failed` record in the demo admin and confirm the
new "Re-send to Mzizi" button renders. No relay was exercised on production, per
the no-test-applications rule.

## 2026-08-20 — Pair each About long-form subsection with its own image
**Area:** website content
**Environments:** demo ✅ · prod ✅
**Commit(s):** 5d5c6f1

The About page's "A learner-centred approach" section reused the compact
two-column intro layout, so eight paragraphs formed one tall block of text
beside a single short image, leaving a large empty gap. Split it into a lead
paragraph plus one image/text row per subsection, alternating sides down the
page and stacking on small screens, using topic-appropriate course photography
rather than repeating the hero image.

**Verified by:** `demo…/about-toolkit-africa/` — 3 rows, images alternate sides
(measured), course images return 200; prod returns 200 with 3 rows, no PHP errors.
**Follow-ups:** none.

## 2026-08-20 — Refresh Toolkit Control admin into a branded console
**Area:** admin UI
**Environments:** demo ✅ · prod ✅
**Commit(s):** 7918e67

Rebuilt `assets/css/toolkit-admin.css` as one design system: instrument-style
header band, legible eyebrow and state badge (the reported low-contrast header
text), branded admin notices, a shared status-chip language, consistent radii,
shadows, hover and focus states. All existing class names preserved, so no
render markup changed.

**Verified by:** Toolkit Control and Applications screens loaded on demo;
contrast issue resolved; prod file verified byte-identical after copy.
**Follow-ups:** keep this UI plain — no further visual iteration unless asked.

## 2026-08-20 — Publish graduation and testimonials showcase to production
**Area:** website content
**Environments:** prod ✅ (was demo-only)
**Commit(s):** b41c546 (deployed, not newly authored)

Copied the graduation and testimonials page templates, 14 graduation images, and
the supporting `footer.php` / `front-page.php` / `page-redesign.css` changes from
demo to production, where they had been committed but never deployed. Routes are
rewrite-driven, and the rules already existed on prod.

**Verified by:** `/graduation/` and `/testimonials/` both 200 on production with
correct titles and images present, no PHP errors.
**Follow-ups:** none.

## 2026-08-20 — Applicant success reliability + Mzizi catalog caching
**Area:** admissions
**Environments:** demo ✅ · prod ✅
**Commit(s):** 5c47631

Applicants now get an immediate success confirmation once their application is
stored locally; the Mzizi relay runs after the response is flushed, so a slow or
failing upstream can never turn a saved application into an applicant-facing
error. The confirmation auto-dismisses after 12s. Mzizi catalog lookups
(campuses, courses, intakes) are cached in 15-minute transients, fixing the slow
course dropdowns.

**Verified by:** `/apply/` 200 on both environments with the new asset version;
options endpoint returned 200 with 3 campuses.
**Follow-ups:** none.

## 2026-08-20 — Housekeeping: removed exposed theme backups
**Area:** security
**Environments:** demo ✅
**Commit(s):** n/a (server-side only)

Moved `functions.php.pre-calling-letters-20260817.bak` and the matching
`inc/application-adapter.php` backup to cPanel trash. This host serves static
extensions directly, bypassing `.htaccess`, so a `.bak` in the webroot was
readable source.

**Verified by:** no `.bak` files remain in the demo theme root or `inc/`.
**Follow-ups:** empty cPanel trash to remove them permanently.
